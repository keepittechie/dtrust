# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks, trolling, or insults
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **[support@kitpro.us]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

1. **Correction** — A private reminder about expected behavior.
2. **Warning** — A warning for continued inappropriate behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban** — A temporary ban from community interaction.
4. **Permanent Ban** — A permanent ban from any project spaces.
